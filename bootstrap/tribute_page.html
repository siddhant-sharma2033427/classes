            Akira Toriyama (Japanese: 鳥山明, Hepburn: Toriyama Akira, April 5, 1955 – March 1, 2024) was a Japanese manga
            artist and character designer. He first achieved mainstream recognition for creating the popular manga
            series Dr. Slump, before going on to create Dragon Ball (his most famous work) and acting as a character
            designer for several popular video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon.
            Toriyama came to be regarded as one of the most important authors in the history of manga with his works
            highly influential and popular, particularly Dragon Ball, which many manga artists cite as a source of
            inspiration.
            He earned the 1981 Shogakukan Manga Award for best shōnen manga with Dr. Slump, and it went on to sell over
            35 million copies in Japan. It was adapted into a successful anime series, with a second anime created in
            1997, 13 years after the manga ended.

            His next series, Dragon Ball, would become one of the most popular and successful manga in the world. Having
            sold 260 million copies worldwide,[1][a][c] it is one of the best-selling manga series of all time and is
            considered to be one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the
            mid-1980s and mid-1990s. Overseas, Dragon Ball's anime adaptations have been more successful than the manga
            and are credited with boosting anime's popularity in the Western world. In 2019, Toriyama was decorated a
            Chevalier of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his contributions to the arts.

            Akira Toriyama was born in the town of Kiyosu, Aichi Prefecture, Japan.[7][8] He had a younger sister.[9]
            Toriyama drew pictures since a young age, mainly of the animals and vehicles that he was fond of. He related
            being blown away after seeing One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961), and said he was drawn deeper into the
            world of illustration by hoping to draw pictures that good.[10] He was shocked again in elementary school
            when he saw the manga collection of a classmate's older brother, and again when he saw a television set for
            the first time at a neighbor's house.[10] He cited Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy (1952–1968) as the original
            source for his interest in manga.[11] Toriyama recalled that when he was in elementary school all of his
            classmates drew imitating anime and manga, as a result of not having many forms of entertainment.[12] He
            believed that he began to advance above everyone else when he started drawing pictures of his friends.[12]
            Despite being engrossed with manga in elementary school, Toriyama said he took a break from it in middle
            school, probably because he became more interested in films and TV shows.[10] When asked if he had any
            formative experiences with tokusatsu entertainment, Toriyama said he enjoyed the Ultraman TV show and Gamera
            series of kaiju films.[13]

            </div>
            In order to seek money after quitting his job at the age of 23, Toriyama entered the manga industry by
            submitting a work to an amateur contest in Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine, which he had randomly picked
            up in a coffee shop.[10][14] The timing did not line up for that contest, but another manga magazine, Weekly
            Shōnen Jump, accepted submissions for their Newcomer Award every month. Kazuhiko Torishima, who would become
            his editor, read and enjoyed Toriyama's manga, but it was not eligible to compete because it was a parody of
            Star Wars instead of an original work. Torishima sent the artist a telegram and encouraged him to keep
            drawing and sending him manga.[14][15] This resulted in Wonder Island, which became Toriyama's first
            published work when it appeared in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1978. It finished last place in the readers
            survey.[10][14] Toriyama later said that he had planned to quit manga after getting paid, but because Wonder
            Island 2 (1978) was also a "flop", his stubbornness would not let him and he continued to draw failed
            stories for a year; claiming around 500 pages' worth, including the published Today's Highlight Island
            (1979).[10] He said he learned a lot during this year and even had some fun. When Torishima told him to draw
            a female lead character, Toriyama hesitantly created 1979's Tomato the Cutesy Gumshoe, which had some
            success. Feeling encouraged, he decided to draw another female lead and created Dr. Slump.[10]

            </div>
            Torishima suggested that, as Toriyama enjoyed kung fu films, he should create a kung fu shōnen manga.[25]
            This led to the two-part Dragon Boy, published in the August and October 1983 issues of Fresh Jump.[22] It
            follows a boy, adept at martial arts, who escorts a princess on a journey back to her home country. Dragon
            Boy was well-received and evolved to become the serial Dragon Ball in 1984.[19][26] But before that, The
            Adventure of Tongpoo was published in Weekly Shōnen Jump's 52nd issue of 1983 and also contained elements
            that would be included in Dragon Ball.[22]

            Serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1984 to 1995 and having sold 159.5 million tankōbon copies in Japan
            alone,[27] Dragon Ball is one of the best-selling manga series of all time.[28] It began as an adventure/gag
            manga but later turned into a martial arts fighting series, considered by many to be the "most influential
            shōnen manga".[16] Dragon Ball was one of the main reasons for the magazine's circulation hitting a record
            high of 6.53 million copies (1995).[29][30] At the series' end, Toriyama said that he asked everyone
            involved to let him end the manga, so he could "take some new steps in life".[31] During that near-11-year
            period, he produced 519 chapters that were collected into 42 volumes. Moreover, the success of the manga led
            to five anime adaptations, several animated films, numerous video games, and mega-merchandise. Aside from
            its popularity in Japan, Dragon Ball was successful internationally as well, including Asia, Europe, and the
            Americas, with 300–350 million copies of the manga sold worldwide.
